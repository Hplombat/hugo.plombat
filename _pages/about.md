 I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan. I work with a foot in the water, and another on the Moon, at the interface between physical oceanography and planetary science.

 My current research focuses on tides and how they changed in the last few decades due to climate change.
 In particular, I'm trying to tackle questions like:
 - What kind of mechanism can affect the tides at the global scale?
 - Are there some cycles, at the annual or monthly scale, in this variation?
 - How can we detect long and short-term changes in the tides? 

Ocean numerical simulations and ocean observations from satellite altimetry are among the most important tools to work on these questions.
But I'm also working with Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) observations, measuring the distance between the Earth and the Moon with centimeter precision!

Why LLR, why the Moon? It all has to do to with my forthcoming paper, why we are wondering: 

**Can climate change on Earth affect the orbit of the Moon?**

The answer (or part of it) coming soon. 


### My past and present in academia

- **Since November 2024:** Postdoc at the University of Michigan in the [Earth and Environmental Sciences department](https://lsa.umich.edu/earth), working with [Brian Arbic](https://arbic.earth.lsa.umich.edu/).
