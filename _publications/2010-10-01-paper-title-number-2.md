We investigate the sensitivity of the 21 cm power spectrum from cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization to models of free-streaming dark radiation (parameterized through $$N_{eff}$$) and interacting dark radiation-dark matter models (DM-DR). The latter models have gained attention for their potential in addressing recent cosmological tensions and structure formation challenges. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis under different assumptions regarding the astrophysical modeling, and forecast the sensitivity of HERA observations, combined with CMB data from Planck and the Simons Observatory (SO), to $$N_{eff}$$ and DM-DR interaction modeled using the ETHOS framework assuming a constant scattering rate between the two components. Most importantly, we find that 21 cm observations can improve the sensitivity to the DM-DR interaction rate by up to four order of magnitude compared to Planck and SO. Conversely, in the limit of low interaction rate (which asymptotically matches $$N_{eff}$$), CMB data dominates the constraining power, but the inclusion of HERA data can provide a ∼ 20% improvement in sensitivity over CMB data alone. Moreover, we find that HERA observations will be able to probe a region of the DM-DR interaction parameter space which is promising to explain the weak lensing amplitude '$$S_8$$' tension. Our results demonstrate the complementarity of 21 cm and CMB data in exploring dark sector interactions.
